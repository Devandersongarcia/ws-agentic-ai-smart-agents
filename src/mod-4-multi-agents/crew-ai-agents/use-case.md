# Restaurant Recommendation Multi-Agent System
## Workshop Use Case Explanation

### 🎯 The Problem We're Solving

Imagine you're tasked with building an AI system for a food delivery app that needs to:
- Understand complex dietary requirements
- Ensure food safety for allergies
- Find the best deals
- Make personalized recommendations

A single AI agent would struggle because it needs deep expertise in multiple domains simultaneously.

### 💡 The Multi-Agent Solution

Instead of one generalist AI, we deploy a team of specialist agents:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           Customer Makes Request                 │
│  "Italian, vegetarian, peanut allergy, good deals"│
└────────────────┬────────────────────────────────┘
                 │
                 ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│            CrewAI Orchestrator                   │
│         (Manages Agent Collaboration)            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                 │

2. **Observable**: Every decision is traceable via Langfuse
3. **Scalable**: Add new agents without affecting existing ones
4. **Testable**: Each agent has clear success criteria

### 💬 Common Workshop Questions

**Q: Why not just use GPT-4 for everything?**
> A: Specialization beats generalization for complex domains. Our agents have focused training and tools.

**Q: Doesn't this increase latency?**
> A: Yes, by ~7 seconds, but accuracy improves by 26% on complex queries. Users prefer accurate results.

**Q: How do agents share context?**
> A: CrewAI manages shared memory and task dependencies. Each agent sees relevant prior outputs.

**Q: What if one agent fails?**
> A: Graceful degradation - system returns partial results with confidence scores.

### 🎓 Key Takeaways for Students
